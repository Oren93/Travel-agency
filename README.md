## Travel Package Booking System
#### About
This is a school project, made for the course Software Development (Þróun hugbúnaðar), the computer science department at the University of Iceland.

The project goal is to learn how to work as a team of programmers, simulating an environment of programming in the real life. The project team consisted of four small teams of 4 students working on one part and four groups together producing an integrated final product.

#### How does it work?
To run the booking software, make sure you downloaded and set up _JavaFX_ in your favorite editor, as well as _SQLite 3_. The main file to run is _Main.java_ which can be found in the _application_ package.
Note that this program doesn’t get data from the internet and has a very limited database for testing purposes only, so focus your search for the interval 20.04.21-30.04.21.

#### Outcome
The main goal of this project for to make a good integration of all the 4 different parts into one. That went well!
There are still issues and bugs that we are well aware of, but did not bother to fix simply because that was not the purpose.
